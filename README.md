# react-todo-list
A simple react app for displaying and creating a list of todo's

### Installing

Install dependencies: `npm install` <br />
Start dev server: `npm start`

## Tests

I have added a few tests for the main list page and the list item component. These are not complete, however they cover a few of the basic functionality.

### Running the tests

`npm run test`


## Notes

`Only tested on Chrome`

- You can add a new item to the list by using the text entry at the top of the page and then pressing enter or the button to the right.
- You can mark an item as done by clicking on it.
- You can mark an item as not done by clicking on it from the 'completed' list.
- You can remove an item by clicking on the red 'X' on an item.
